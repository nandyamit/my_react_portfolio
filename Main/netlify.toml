# Netlify Build Settings Guide

## Basic Build Settings

1. **Build Command**
```bash
npm run build
```

2. **Publish Directory**
```
dist
```

3. **Environment Variables**
If needed, add these in Netlify's deploy settings:
```env
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Netlify Configuration File
Create a `netlify.toml` in your project root:

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"
  node_version = "20.17.0"  # Specify your Node.js version

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20.17.0"
  NPM_VERSION = "10.2.3"    # Specify NPM version if needed

# Production context: All deploys from the main repository branch
[context.production]
  command = "npm run build"

# Deploy Preview context: All deploys generated from a pull/merge request
[context.deploy-preview]
  command = "npm run build"

# Branch deploy context: All deploys that are not from a pull/merge request or from the main repository branch
[context.branch-deploy]
  command = "npm run build"

# Redirects and headers are GLOBAL for all builds
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

# Asset optimization
[build.processing]
  skip_processing = false
[build.processing.css]
  bundle = true
  minify = true
[build.processing.js]
  bundle = true
  minify = true
[build.processing.html]
  pretty_urls = true
[build.processing.images]
  compress = true

# Headers to return with requests for the specified paths
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    Referrer-Policy = "no-referrer-when-downgrade"
```

## Step-by-Step Setup in Netlify UI

1. **Basic Build Settings**
   - Navigate to Site settings > Build & deploy > Build settings
   - Set build command: `npm run build`
   - Set publish directory: `dist`

2. **Deploy Settings**
   - Branch to deploy: `main`
   - Auto publishing: Enable
   - Asset optimization: Enable
   - Pretty URLs: Enable
   - Prerendering: Enable if needed

3. **Advanced Build Settings**
   ```
   Base directory: Not set
   Package directory: Not set
   Build command: npm run build
   Publish directory: dist
   Deploy log visibility: Ignore warnings
   ```

4. **Environment Variables**
   Navigate to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment
   ```
   NODE_ENV: production
   ```

5. **Deploy Contexts**
   Create `netlify.toml` with different contexts:
   - Production (main branch)
   - Deploy previews (PRs)
   - Branch deploys

6. **Post Processing**
   Enable in Site settings > Build & deploy > Post processing
   - Bundle CSS
   - Bundle JS
   - Minify CSS
   - Minify JS
   - Minify HTML
   - Image optimization

7. **Forms**
   If using Netlify Forms:
   ```html
   <form name="contact" netlify>
   ```

8. **Functions**
   If using Netlify Functions, specify directory:
   ```toml
   [build]
     functions = "netlify/functions"
   ```

## Recommended Build Plugin Settings

Add these to your `netlify.toml`:

```toml
[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-lighthouse"

[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-submit-sitemap"

[[plugins]]
  package = "netlify-plugin-inline-critical-css"
```

## Performance Optimization Settings

```toml
# Cache Control Headers
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.js"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000"

[[headers]]
  for = "/*.css"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000"

[[headers]]
  for = "/img/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=31536000"
```
